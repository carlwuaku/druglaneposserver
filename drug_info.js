Concomitant use of drugs affecting the renin angiotensin system Combination therapy with two drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, and aliskiren) is not recommended due to an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and renal impairment, compared to use of a single drug. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are particularly susceptible to developing hyperkalaemia and should not be given an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. There is some evidence that the benefits of combination use of an ACE inhibitor with candesartan or valsartan may outweigh the risks in selected patients with heart failure for whom other treatments are unsuitable, however, the concomitant use of this combination, together with an aldosterone antagonist or a potassiumsparing diuretic is not recommended. For patients currently taking combination therapy, the need for continued combined therapy should be reviewed. If combination therapy is considered essential, it should be carried out under specialist supervision, with close monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes (particularly potassium); monitoring should be considered at the start of treatment, then monthly, and also after any change in dose or during intercurrent illness.', '', 8),

The plasmatheophylline\nconcentration is increased in heart failure,\nhepatic impairment, and in viral infections. The plasmatheophylline\nconcentration is decreased in smokers, and\nby alcohol consumption. Differences in the half-life of\naminophylline are important because the toxic dose is\nclose to the therapeutic dose.', 'Arrhythmias (especially if given rapidly by intravenous injection). CNS stimulation . convulsions (especially if given rapidly by intravenous injection). diarrhoea . gastric irritation . headache . hypotension (especially if given rapidly by intravenous injection). insomnia . nausea . palpitation .tachycardia . vomiting SIDE-EFFECTS, FURTHER INFORMATION ? Hypokalaemia Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from beta2 agonist therapy. Particular caution is required in severe asthma, because this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with theophylline and its derivatives, corticosteroids, and diuretics, and by hypoxia. Plasma-potassium concentration should therefore be monitored in severe asthma. Overdose Theophylline and related drugs are often prescribed as modified-release formulations and toxicity can therefore be delayed. They cause vomiting (which may be severe and intractable), agitation, restlessness, dilated pupils, sinus tachycardia, and hyperglycaemia. More serious effects are haematemesis, convulsions, and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Severe hypokalaemia may develop rapidly.

Withdrawal bleeding Cyclical HRT (where a progestogen is\ntaken for 12–14 days of each 28-day oestrogen treatment\ncycle) usually results in regular withdrawal bleeding\ntowards the end of the progestogen. The aim of\ncontinuous combined HRT (where a combination of\noestrogen and progestogen is taken, usually in a singletablet, throughout each 28-day treatment cycle) is to avoid\nbleeding, but irregular bleeding may occur during the early\ntreatment stages (if it continues endometrial abnormality\nshould be excluded and consideration given to cyclical\nHRT instead)', 'Acute porphyrias p. 930 . diabetes (increased\nrisk of heart disease).factors predisposing to\nthromboembolism . history of breast nodules (closely\nmonitor breast status—risk of breast cancer). history of\nendometrial hyperplasia . history of fibrocystic disease\n(closely monitor breast status—risk of breast cancer). hypophyseal tumours . increased risk of gall-bladder\ndisease reported . migraine . migraine-like headaches . presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (increased risk of\nthrombotic events).risk factors for oestrogen-dependent\ntumours (e.g. breast cancer in first-degree relative).risk of\nbreast cancer\nCAUTIONS, FURTHER INFORMATION\n? Risk of breast cancer It is estimated that using all types of\nHRT, including tibolone, increases the risk of breast cancer\nwithin 1–2 years of initiating treatment. The increased risk\nis related to the duration of HRT use (but not to the age atwhich HRT is started) and this excess risk disappears\nwithin 5 years of stopping.\nRadiological detection of breast cancer can be made\nmore difficult as mammographic density can increase with\nHRT use.\n? Risk of endometrial cancer The increased risk of endometrial\ncancer depends on the dose and duration of oestrogenonly\nHRT.\nIn women with a uterus, the addition of a progestogen\ncyclically (for at least 10 days per 28-day cycle) reduces the\nadditional risk of endometrial cancer; this additional risk is\neliminated if a progestogen is given continuously.\nHowever, this should be weighed against the increased risk\nof breast cancer.\n? Risk of ovarian cancer Long-term use of combined HRT or\noestrogen-only HRT is associated with a small increased\nrisk of ovarian cancer. This excess risk disappears within a\nfew years of stopping.\n? Risk of venous thromboembolism Women using combined or\noestrogen-only HRT are at an increased risk of deep vein\nthrombosis and of pulmonary embolism especially in the\nfirst year of use.\nIn women who have predisposing factors (such as a\npersonal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or\npulmonary embolism, severe varicose veins, obesity,\ntrauma, or prolonged bed-rest) it is prudent to review the\nneed for HRT, as in some cases the risks of HRT may\nexceed the benefits.\nTravel involving prolonged immobility further increases\nthe risk of deep vein thrombosis.\n? Risk of stroke Risk of stroke increases with age, therefore\nolder women have a greater absolute risk of stroke.\nCombined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT slightly increases\nthe risk of stroke.\n? Risk of coronary heart disease HRT does not prevent coronary\nheart disease and should not be prescribed for this\npurpose. There is an increased risk of coronary heart\ndisease in women who start combined HRT more than\n10 years after menopause. Although very little information\nis available on the risk of coronary heart disease in\nyounger women who start HRT close to the menopause,\nstudies suggest a lower relative risk compared with older\nwomen.\n? Other conditions The product literature advises caution in\nother conditions including hypertension, renal disease,\nasthma, epilepsy, sickle-cell disease, melanoma,\notosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus\nerythematosus (but care required if antiphospholipid\nantibodies present). Evidence for caution in these\nconditions is unsatisfactory and many women with these\nconditions may stand to benefit from HRT.', 'Y Not known to be harmful.\nl BREAST FEEDING Avoid until weaning or for 6 months\nafter birth (adverse effects on lactation).', 678),

Withdrawal bleeding Cyclical HRT (where a progestogen is\ntaken for 12–14 days of each 28-day oestrogen treatment\ncycle) usually results in regular withdrawal bleeding\ntowards the end of the progestogen. The aim of\ncontinuous combined HRT (where a combination of\noestrogen and progestogen is taken, usually in a single\ntablet, throughout each 28-day treatment cycle) is to avoid\nbleeding, but irregular bleeding may occur during the early\ntreatment stages (if it continues endometrial abnormality\nshould be excluded and consideration given to cyclical\nHRT instead).', 'Acute porphyrias p. 930 . diabetes (increased\nrisk of heart disease). history of breast nodules—closely\nmonitor breast status (risk of breast cancer). history of\nendometrial hyperplasia; factors predisposing to\nthromboembolism . history of fibrocystic disease—closely\nmonitor breast status (risk of breast cancer). hypophyseal\ntumours . increased risk of gall-bladder disease . migraine\n(or migraine-like headaches). presence of\nantiphospholipid antibodies (increased risk of thrombotic\nevents). prolonged exposure to unopposed oestrogens\nmay increase risk of developing endometrial cancer.risk\nfactors for oestrogen-dependent tumours (e.g. breast\ncancer in first-degree relative). symptoms of\nendometriosis may be exacerbated . uterine fibroids may\nincrease in size\nCAUTIONS, FURTHER INFORMATION\n? Risk of breast cancer It is estimated that using all types of\nHRT increases the risk of breast cancer within 1–2 years of\ninitiating treatment. The increased risk is related to the\nduration of HRT use (but not to the age at which HRT is\nstarted) and this excess risk disappears within 5 years of\nstopping.\nRadiological detection of breast cancer can be made\nmore difficult as mammographic density can increase with\nHRT use.\n? Risk of endometrial cancer The increased risk of endometrial\ncancer depends on the dose and duration of oestrogenonly\nHRT.\nIn women with a uterus, the addition of a progestogen\ncyclically (for at least 10 days per 28-day cycle) reduces the\nadditional risk of endometrial cancer; this additional risk is\neliminated if a progestogen is given continuously.\nHowever, this should be weighed against the increased risk\nof breast cancer.\n? Risk of ovarian cancer Long-term use of combined HRT or\noestrogen-only HRT is associated with a small increased\nrisk of ovarian cancer. This excess risk disappears within a\nfew years of stopping.\n? Risk of venous thromboembolism Women using combined or\noestrogen-only HRT are at an increased risk of deep vein\nthrombosis and of pulmonary embolism especially in the\nfirst year of use.\nIn women who have predisposing factors (such as a\npersonal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or\npulmonary embolism, severe varicose veins, obesity,\ntrauma, or prolonged bed-rest) it is prudent to review the\nneed for HRT, as in some cases the risks of HRT may\nexceed the benefits.\nTravel involving prolonged immobility further increases\nthe risk of deep vein thrombosis.\n? Risk of stroke Risk of stroke increases with age, therefore\nolder women have a greater absolute risk of stroke.Combined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT slightly increases\nthe risk of stroke.\n? Risk of coronary heart disease HRT does not prevent coronary\nheart disease and should not be prescribed for this\npurpose. There is an increased risk of coronary heart\ndisease in women who start combined HRT more than\n10 years after menopause. Although very little information\nis available on the risk of coronary heart disease in\nyounger women who start HRT close to the menopause,\nstudies suggest a lower relative risk compared with older\nwomen.\n? Other conditions The product literature advises caution in\nother conditions including hypertension, renal disease,\nasthma, epilepsy, sickle-cell disease, melanoma,\notosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus\nerythematosus (but care required if antiphospholipid\nantibodies present). Evidence for caution in these\nconditions is unsatisfactory and many women with these\nconditions may stand to benefit from HRT.', 'Not known to be harmful.\nl BREAST FEEDING Avoid; adverse effects on lactation', 679),

The following recommendations relate\nto hydroxychloroquine, which is only rarely associated\nwith toxicity.\nBefore treatment:\n. Assess renal and liver function (adjust dose if impaired)\n. Ask patient about visual impairment (not corrected by\nglasses). If impairment or eye disease present,\nassessment by an optometrist is advised and any\nabnormality should be referred to an ophthalmologist\n. Record near visual acuity of each eye (with glasses where\nappropriate) using a standard reading chart\n. Initiate hydroxychloroquine treatment if no abnormality\ndetected (at a dose not exceeding hydroxychloroquine\nsulfate 6.5 mg/kg daily)\nDuring treatment:\n. Ask patient about visual symptoms and monitor visual\nacuity annually using the standard reading chart\n. Refer to ophthalmologist if visual acuity changes or if\nvision blurred and warn patient to seek prescribing\ndoctor’s advice about stopping treatment\n. If long-term treatment is required (more than 5 years),\nindividual arrangement should be agreed with the local\nophthalmologist', 'It is not necessary to withdraw an\nantimalarial drug during pregnancy if the rheumatic\ndisease is well controlled; however, the manufacturer of\nhydroxychloroquine advises avoiding use.\nBREAST FEEDING Avoid—risk of toxicity in infant', 890),

Tuberculosis Manufacturer advises to evaluate patients for active and latent tuberculosis before treatment. Active tuberculosis should be treated with standard treatment for at least 2 months before starting infliximab. If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment should be started before commencing treatment with infliximab. Patients who have previously received adequate treatment for tuberculosis can start infliximab but should be monitored every 3 months for possible recurrence. In patients without active tuberculosis but who were previously not treated adequately, chemoprophylaxis should ideally be completed before starting infliximab. In patients at high risk of tuberculosis who cannot be assessed by tuberculin skin test, chemoprophylaxis can be given concurrently with infliximab. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis develop (e.g. persistent cough, weight loss and fever). ? Hypersensitivity reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (including fever, chest pain, hypotension, hypertension, dyspnoea, transient visual loss, pruritus, urticaria, serum sickness-like reactions, angioedema, anaphylaxis) reported during or within 1–2 hours after infusion (risk greatest during first or second infusion or in patients who discontinue other immunosuppressants).

Muscle effects The risk of myopathy, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis associated with statin use is rare. Although myalgia has been reported commonly in patients receiving statins, muscle toxicity truly attributable to statin use is rare. Muscle toxicity can occur with all statins, however the likelihood increases with higher doses. If muscular symptoms or raised creatine kinase occur during treatment, other possible causes (e.g. rigorous physical activity, hypothyroidism, infection, recent trauma, and drug or alcohol addiction) should be excluded before statin therapy is implicated, particularly if statin treatment has previously been tolerated for more than 3 months. When a statin is suspected to be the cause of myopathy, and creatine kinase concentration is markedly elevated (more than 5 times upper limit of normal), or if muscular symptoms are severe, treatment should be discontinued. If symptoms resolve and creatine kinase concentrations return to normal, the statin should be reintroduced at a lower dose and the patient monitored closely; an alternative statin should be prescribed if unacceptable side-effects are experienced with a particular statin. Statins should not be discontinued in the event of small, asymptomatic elevations of creatine kinase. Routine monitoring of creatine kinase is unnecessary in asymptomatic patients. Statins should not be discontinued if there is an increase in the blood-glucose concentration or HbA1C as the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. ? Interstitial lung disease If patients develop symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough, and weight loss, they should seek medical attention.', 'Elderly . high alcohol intake . history of liver disease . hypothyroidism . patients at increased risk of muscle toxicity, including myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (e.g. those with a personal or family history of muscular disorders, previous history of muscular toxicity and a high alcohol intake) CAUTIONS, FURTHER INFORMATION ? Muscle effects Muscle toxicity can occur with all statins, however the likelihood increases with higher doses and in certain patients (see below). Statins should be used with caution in patients at increased risk of muscle toxicity, including those with a personal or family history of muscular disorders, previous history of muscular toxicity, a high alcohol intake, renal impairment or hypothyroidism. In patients at increased risk of muscle effects, a statin should not usually be started if the baseline creatine kinase concentration is more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (some patients may present with an extremely elevated baseline creatine kinase concentration, for example because of a physical occupation or rigorous exercise—specialist advice should be sought regarding consideration of statin therapy in these patients). ?

The plasmatheophylline\nconcentration is increased in heart failure,\nhepatic impairment, and in viral infections. The plasmatheophylline\nconcentration is decreased in smokers, and\nby alcohol consumption. Differences in the half-life of\ntheophylline are important because the toxic dose is\nclose to the therapeutic dose.', 'Arrhythmias . CNS stimulation . convulsions . diarrhoea . gastric irritation . headache . insomnia . nausea . palpitation .tachycardia . vomiting SIDE-EFFECTS, FURTHER INFORMATION ? Hypokalaemia Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from beta2 agonist therapy. Particular caution is required in severe asthma, because this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with theophylline and its derivatives, corticosteroids, and diuretics, and by hypoxia. Plasma-potassium concentration should therefore be monitored in severe asthma. Overdose Theophylline in overdose can cause vomiting (which may be severe and intractable), agitation, restlessness, dilated pupils, sinus tachycardia, and hyperglycaemia. More serious effects are haematemesis, convulsions, and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Severe hypokalaemia may develop rapidly. For details on the management of poisoning, see Theophylline, under Emergency treatment of poisoning p. 1209.', 'Cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease . elderly (increased plasma-theophylline concentration). epilepsy . fever. hypertension . hyperthyroidism . peptic ulcer.risk of hypokalaemia', 'Neonatal irritability and apnoea have been reported.
